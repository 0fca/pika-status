PikaStatus aka Monica is an SPA web app which is designed to be a status page for all systems in PikaCloud

## Main purpose

Its main purpose is to be just an experiment so I could use Blazor framework. I know I could use ready to use ootb
solutions for status of PikaCloud, but as I said, it is just an experiment - and it works.

## TODO

I do not plan to extend its functionalities.
